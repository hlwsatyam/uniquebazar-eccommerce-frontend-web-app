        The Information and Communication revolution has brought enormous
        changes in the way we organize our lives, our economies, industries and
        institutions. These spectacular developments in modern times have
        undoubtedly enhanced the quality of our lives, but at the same time,
        have led to manifold problems including the problem of massive amount of
        hazardous waste and other waste generated from electric products. Such
        waste poses a serious threat to human health and environment. The issue
        of proper management of such hazardous E-Waste is therefore critical to
        the protection of livelihood, health and environment.
      </p>
      <p className="my-2 text-[12px]">
        To deal with this ever-rising problem of E-Waste, the government of
        India, through its Ministry of Environment and forest, formulated the
        E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules in 2011.
